This update optimizes the transformer model, making it more efficient and reducing its memory footprint. The new revision, DLSS 310.3.0, improves the transformer model's VRAM usage, bringing it closer to the older CNN model's memory impact.\\n\\n## Highlight\\nThe key points of this update include:\\n* 20% reduction in VRAM usage for upscaling\\n* Optimizations reduce the overhead of the more powerful transformer model\\n* The new transformer model consumes 40% more memory than the CNN model, down from nearly twice as much\\n* Memory consumption increases linearly with resolution, with the transformer model consuming 85.77MB of VRAM at 1080p and 307.37MB at 4K\\n\\n## Why it matters\\nThis update is significant because it shows Nvidia's commitment to improving the efficiency of its DLSS technology. While the 20% reduction in VRAM usage may not have a noticeable impact on real-world applications, it demonstrates the company's efforts to optimize its technology for better performance. Additionally, the reduction in memory footprint could be beneficial for systems with limited VRAM, particularly at higher resolutions like 8K.
