    "Let’s assume your company plans to build a smart assistant that can answer not only general questions but also specific ones related to your internal company documents. It is difficult for an LLM to answer such questions if it has not been studied on the topic beforehand.\n",

    "The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline is an approach in natural language processing (NLP) that improves answer accuracy by retrieving relevant information before generating a response. It combines information retrieval with language generation techniques and serves as a solution to enhance the performance of generative models by incorporating a retriever component."

    "## Why is RAG pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, RAG pipeline demonstrates its prowess of retrieving the relevant contexts from diverse data sources. It is a powerful tool that pushes the capability of a normal LLM to a new frontier. In a nushell, there are three principal advantages of using RAG such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empowering LLM with real-time data access**:\n",
    "Because the business context always constantly changes over time. Therefore, data is constantly dynamic and transformed in an enterprise that demands AI solutions, which can use LLMs to have the ability to remain up-to-date and current with RAG to facilitate direct access to additional data resources. Ideally, these resources should comprise of real-time and personalized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preserving data privacy**:\n",
    "Many enterprise data is sensitive and confidential. That is why the commercial LLM models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, Grok, and Gemini are banned in several corporations, especially in the case where data is considered as the new gold. Therefore, ensuring data privacy is crucial for enterprises.To this end, with a self-hosted LLM (demonstrated in the RAG workflow), sensitive data can be retained on-premises just like the local stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mitigating LLM hallucinations**:\n",
    "In fact since many LLMs lack access to factual and real-time information, they often generate inaccurate responses but seem convincing. This phenomenon, so-called hallucination, is mitigated by RAG, which reduces the likelihood of hallucinations by providing the LLM with relevant and factional information.\n",

    "![](./rag_langchain_engine.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Retriever**\n",
    "\n",
    "The retriever finds relevant information from a large collection of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data ingestion: Data is collected from various sources like PDFs, text files, emails, or websites.\n",
    "- Document preprocessing: Long documents are split into smaller parts to make them easier to handle.\n",
    "- Generating embeddings: Each part is turned into a numeric vector using an embedding model.\n",
    "- Storing in vector databases: These vectors are saved in a special database for fast searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Generator**\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator uses a language model to create a response based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs: A large language model reads the user query and the retrieved text to write an answer.\n",
    "- Querying: The system compares the user query with saved vectors to find matching text before generating a reply.\n"

      "Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\n",
