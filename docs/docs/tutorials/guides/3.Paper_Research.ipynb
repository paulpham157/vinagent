            "### Introduction\n",
            "\n",
            "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions in complex, uncertain environments. Deep Q-learning, a type of RL, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to learn from raw sensory inputs and make decisions in high-dimensional spaces. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the different methodologies, performance metrics, advantages, and limitations of various approaches in reinforcement learning and deep Q-learning.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Methodologies\n",

            "2. **Continuous Control Tasks:** Some papers, such as \"Decorrelated Double Q-learning\" (arXiv ID: 2006.06956v1) and \"A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Learn Transferable Policies\" (arXiv ID: 1805.10209), evaluate their performance on robotic control tasks, which require learning complex control policies.\n",

            "### Advantages and Limitations\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Double Q-Learning:** Advantages - reduces overestimation of Q-values; Limitations - can be computationally expensive.\n",

            "3. **Dueling Networks:** Advantages - improves learning stability; Limitations - requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.\n",
            "4. **Prioritized Experience Replay:** Advantages - focuses on important experiences; Limitations - can introduce bias into the learning process.\n",
