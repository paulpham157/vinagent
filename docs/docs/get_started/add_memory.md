# Agent memory
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/datascienceworld-kan/vinagent-docs/blob/main/docs/tutorials/get_started/add_memory.ipynb)

`Vinagent` features a `Graphical Memory` system that transforms messages into a structured knowledge graph composed of nodes, relationships, and edges. This memory can be organized into short-term and long-term components, allowing the Agent to retain and recall learned information effectively.

Compared to traditional `Conversational Memory, Graphical Memory` offers distinct advantages: it condenses essential information into a graph format, reducing hallucinations by filtering out redundant or irrelevant details. Additionally, because it operates with a shorter context length, it significantly lowers computational costs.

This graph-based approach mirrors how humans conceptualize and retain knowledge, making it especially powerful for capturing the core meaning of complex conversations.

## Setup

Install `vinagent` package


```python
%pip install vinagent
```

Write environment variable


```python
%%writefile .env
TOGETHER_API_KEY="Your together API key"
TAVILY_API_KEY="Your Tavily API key"
```

## Initialize Memory

Vinagent is outstanding with organizing Memory as a Knowledge Graph. We leverage `AucoDB` features to enhance graph's capabilities of agent. The graph-based features is supported as follows:

- Graph Construction: Builds knowledge graphs from documents using `LLMGraphTransformer` class from AucoDB, extracting entities (nodes) and relationships with enriched properties such as categories, roles, or timestamps.

- Property Enrichment: Enhances nodes and relationships with contextual attributes derived from the input text, improving graph expressiveness.

- Graph Visualization: Visualizes the constructed graph and exports it as a html file for easy sharing and analysis.

- Neo4j Integration: Stores and manages graphs in a Neo4j database with secure client initialization.

- Flexible Input: Processes unstructured text to create structured graphs, suitable for applications like knowledge management, AI research, and data analysis.

Prerequisites

- Neo4j Database: A running Neo4j instance (local or remote).
- Python Packages: Install required dependencies:

```
pip install langchain-together neo4j python-dotenv
```

```python
from langchain_together.chat_models import ChatTogether
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
from vinagent.memory import Memory

load_dotenv(find_dotenv('.env'))

llm = ChatTogether(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free"
)

memory = Memory(
    memory_path="templates/memory.jsonl",
    is_reset_memory=True, # will reset the memory every time the agent is invoked
    is_logging=True
)
```

## Load memory by user_id

Memory is organized by `user_id` to segment each user’s data within the long-term memory. Before starting a conversation, the agent can access the memory associated with the given `user_id`, which helps prevent confusion between users the agent has previously interacted with and toward on a more personalized experience. For instance, if the agent has a conversation with Mr. Kan, it can recall all that information in future sessions by referencing `user_id='Kan'`.

```python
message_user = memory.load_memory_by_user(load_type='list', user_id="Kan")
```


```python
message_user
```

    [{
          "head": "Kan",
          "head_type": "Person",
          "relation": "PARTICIPATED_IN",
          "relation_properties": "since 2024",
          "tail": "Google I/O",
          "tail_type": "Event"
      },
      {
          "head": "Kan",
          "head_type": "Person",
          "relation": "HAS_MOTTO",
          "relation_properties": "",
          "tail": "Make the world better with data and models",
          "tail_type": "Motto"
      },
      ...
    ]

Therefore, Agent can utilize this personalized graph-based memory to provide more accurate and relevant responses, which align with user's preferences.


## Agent with memory

This feature allows to adhere `Memory` for each `Agent`. This is useful when you want to keep track of the user's behavior and conceptualize knowledge as a graph. As a result, it helps agent become more intelligent and capable of understanding personality and responding to user queries with greater accuracy.

We structure our memory as a dictionary, where each key represents a user identifier. This memory is then injected into the Agent during initialization by setting `memory_path="your_memory_path.jsonl"` as a long-term memory.

Asking agent with user_id = 'Kan'

```
import os
import sys
from langchain_together import ChatTogether 
from vinagent.agent import Agent
from vinagent.memory.memory import Memory
from pathlib import Path
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

llm = ChatTogether(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free"
)

# Step 1: Create Agent with tools
agent = Agent(
    llm = llm,
    description="You are my close friend",
    skills=[
        "You can remember all memory related to us",
        "You can remind the memory to answer questions",
        "You can remember the history of our relationship"
    ],
    memory_path='templates/memory.jsonl',
    is_reset_memory=False # If True, reset memory each time re-initialize agent, else use existing memory
)

# Step 2: invoke the agent
message = agent.invoke("What is your Motto?", user_id="Kan")
message.content
```
  "Kan's motto is Make the world better with data and models."

Each message in the conversation is considered as a short-term memory. You can save them to long-term memory under the Graph form by setting `is_save_memory=True`.

```
message = agent.invoke("Hi, I'm Kan, who is a leader of Vinagent project", user_id="Kan", is_save_memory=True)
```

A new information is saved into memory about Mr. Kan is the leader of Vinagent project.

```
!cat templates/memory.jsonl
```

    {
      "Kan": [
          {
              "head": "Kan",
              "head_type": "Person",
              "relation": "PARTICIPATED_IN",
              "relation_properties": "since 2024",
              "tail": "Google I/O",
              "tail_type": "Event"
          },
          {
              "head": "Kan",
              "head_type": "Person",
              "relation": "HAS_MOTTO",
              "relation_properties": "",
              "tail": "Make the world better with data and models",
              "tail_type": "Motto"
          },
          {
              "head": "Kan",
              "head_type": "Person",
              "relation": "LEADS",
              "relation_properties": "",
              "tail": "Vinagent project",
              "tail_type": "Project"
          }
      ]
    }

## Visualize on Neo4j

You can explore the knowledge graph on-premise using the Neo4j dashboard at `http://localhost:7474/browser/`. This allows you to intuitively understand the nodes and relationships within your data.

To enable this visualization, the `AucoDBNeo4jClient`, a client instance from the `AucoDB` library, supports ingesting graph memory directly into a `Neo4j` database. Once the data is ingested, you can use `Cypher` queries to retrieve nodes and edges for inspection or further analysis.

!!! note
    Authentication: Access to the Neo4j dashboard requires login using the same `username/password` credentials configured in your Docker environment (e.g., via the NEO4J_AUTH variable).

If you prefer not to use the `Neo4j` web interface, the `AucoDBNeo4jClient` also provides a convenient method to export the entire graph to an HTML file, which is `client.visualize_graph(output_path="my_graph.html")`.

This method generates a standalone HTML file containing an interactive graph visualization, ideal for embedding in reports or sharing with others without requiring Neo4j access.

### Start Neo4j service

Neo4j database can be install as a docker service. We need to create a `docker-compose.yml` file on local and start `Neo4j` database as follows:



```python
%%writefile docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  neo4j:
    image: neo4j:latest
    container_name: neo4j
    ports:
      - "7474:7474"
      - "7687:7687"
    environment:
      - NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/abc@12345
```

Start `neo4j` service by command:


```python
docker-compose up
```

### Export Knowledge Graph

Install dependency `AucoDB` library to ingest knowledge graph to `Neo4j` database and and export graph to html file.

```
%pip install aucodb
```

Initialze client instance

```python
from langchain_together.chat_models import ChatTogether
from aucodb.graph.neo4j_client import AucoDBNeo4jClient
from aucodb.graph import LLMGraphTransformer
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Step 1: Initialize AucoDBNeo4jClient
# Method 1: dirrectly passing arguments, but not ensure security
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"  # Update with your Neo4j URI
NEO4J_USER = "neo4j"  # Update with your Neo4j username
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "abc@12345"  # Update with your Neo4j password

client = AucoDBNeo4jClient(uri = NEO4J_URI, user = NEO4J_USER, password = NEO4J_PASSWORD)
```


```python
# Step 2: Save user memory into jsonline
import json

with open("user_memory.jsonl", "w") as f:
    for item in message_user:
        f.write(json.dumps(item) + "\n")
```


```python
# Step 3: Load user_memory.jsonl into Neo4j.
client.load_json_to_neo4j(
    json_file='user_memory.jsonl',
    is_reset_db=False
)
```


```python
# Step 4: Export graph into my_graph.html file.
client.visualize_graph(output_file="my_graph.html", show_in_browser=True)
```
