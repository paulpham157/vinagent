# Build local ReactJS App

We offer a folked repo [Agentools UI](https://github.com/tathao/agentools/tree/feature/ui#5-integration-guide), contributed by Hao Nguyen, that allows chatting with the Vinagent Agent through an interactive interface. You can operate your Agent locally and select from a list of relevant tools. You can obtain artifact visualization displayed on the right pannel of UI, such as tabular, data, plot, and more, which can be easily downloaded to your local.
